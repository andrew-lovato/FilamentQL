            FilamentQL is a lightweight caching library for GraphQL queries that
            utilizes a parsing algorithm to detect differences between incoming
            queries and existing data stored within the cache. The library
            offers tools for both client and server side caching as well as
            tools for offline mode.{' '}
          </h3>
          <p>
            FilamentQL's parsing algorithm only selects the fields within the
            query that are not in the cache. It then constructs a new query to
            be sent to the GraphQL server as well as package up the data from
            the cache. Once the data arrives from the database, FilamentQL
            combines the data into the same shape that was initially queried.
          </p>
          <p>
            Offline mode is a feature of the FilamentQL library. It offers tools
            to store queries and mutations in a queue which will then detect
            internet using navigator.onLine. Once detected the queue will then
            send its contents, one by one, off to the server.
